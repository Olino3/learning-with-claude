# Exercise 1: Enumerable Mastery

Practice Ruby's powerful Enumerable methods for data transformation.

## Challenge: Sales Data Analysis

Given sales data, perform various transformations and analyses.

```ruby
sales = [
  { product: 'Laptop', price: 1200, quantity: 2, category: 'Electronics' },
  { product: 'Mouse', price: 25, quantity: 5, category: 'Electronics' },
  { product: 'Desk', price: 300, quantity: 1, category: 'Furniture' },
  { product: 'Chair', price: 150, quantity: 4, category: 'Furniture' },
  { product: 'Monitor', price: 400, quantity: 2, category: 'Electronics' }
]
```

**Tasks:**
1. Total revenue per category
2. Products with revenue > $500
3. Average price by category
4. Top 3 products by revenue
5. Transform to hash by category
