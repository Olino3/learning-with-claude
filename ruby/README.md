# Ruby Learning Path

Welcome to the Ruby learning repository! This section contains progressive tutorials, labs, and reading materials to help you learn Ruby application development.

## 📚 Structure

This repository is organized into three main sections:

### `/tutorials`
Step-by-step tutorials that guide you through Ruby concepts and programming techniques. Each tutorial builds upon previous knowledge, creating a progressive learning experience.

### `/labs`
Hands-on projects and practical exercises where you can apply what you've learned. These labs provide real-world scenarios to practice Ruby development.

### `/reading`
Reference materials, documentation, and in-depth information about Ruby concepts, best practices, and advanced topics.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

This repository uses Git commits to track your learning progress. Each commit represents a step in your learning journey, allowing you to:
- See how applications are built incrementally
- Understand the evolution of code
- Review previous concepts easily
- Track your progress over time
