[Optional: List specific concepts that should be understood before starting]

## 🐍➡️🔴 Coming from Python

If you're familiar with Python's [related topic], here's how Ruby concepts map:

| Python | Ruby | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| [Python pattern] | [Ruby pattern] | [Key difference] |
| [Python syntax] | [Ruby syntax] | [Important note] |
| [Python concept] | [Ruby concept] | [When to use] |

📘 **Python Note:** [Explain the most important conceptual difference between Python and Ruby for this topic. This should be a 2-3 sentence explanation that helps Python developers understand the mental model shift required.]

## 📝 Section 1: [First Major Topic]

[Introduction to this section - explain what will be covered]

### Basic Concept

[Explain the fundamental concept clearly and concisely]

```ruby
# Example demonstrating the concept
# Comments explaining what's happening

# Python equivalent: [show Python code]
# Ruby approach:
[ruby code here]

# Output:
# => [expected output]
```

📘 **Python Note:** [Explain how this differs from Python or what Python developers should pay attention to]

### Practical Usage

[Show how this concept is used in real code]

```ruby
# Realistic example (not toy code)
[practical code example]

# Output:
# => [expected output]
```

## 📝 Section 2: [Second Major Topic]

[Follow the same pattern for each major section]

### [Subsection title]

[Content]

```ruby
# Code example
```

📘 **Python Note:** [Python comparison]

## 📝 Section 3: [Third Major Topic]

[Continue pattern...]

## 📝 Section 4: [Fourth Major Topic]

[Typically include 4-6 major sections total]
